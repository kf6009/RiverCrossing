# RiverCrossing
A farmer is on the bank of a river with a wolf, a sheep and a cabbage. He wants to cross the river, taking with him the wolf, sheep, and cabbage. There is a boat that can fit the farmer plus one of the wolf, the sheep, or the cabbage. However, if the wolf and the sheep are ever left on the same bank without the farmer, the wolf will eat the sheep. If the sheep and the cabbage are ever left on the same bank without the farmer, the sheep will eat the cabbage. How can the farmer safely transport the wolf, the sheep, and the cabbage so that all of them are eventually on the other side of the river together?
